# Justin's Piscine
Writing this after the first day: I had an awful start. My sleep schedule went on a downward spiral thanks to health issues so I was very exhausted on the first day and had to leave after only clocking 6 hours. I decided to give up on the Shell project hoping it'd allow me to do the C projects, but the C projects were still locked. I decided to just do the C projects at home after midnight when I am awake.
